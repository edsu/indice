description: The optional home-level config.yaml and its footprint knobs.
---

An optional `<home>/config.yaml` holds home-level settings. The file is optional and every field has a default, so you only write the knobs you want to change; unknown keys are ignored (the file can grow over time). Run `indice config` to print the resolved values (your file merged over the defaults).

```yaml
index:
  # Bytes of page body text STORED per document for snippets, in KiB. The full
  # body is always indexed, so search recall is unaffected — this only bounds
  # the stored copy used to render snippets. Lower = smaller index. Omit for the
  # 16 KiB default; 0 stores the whole body (no cap).
  stored_body_cap_kb: 16
  # Tantivy indexing buffer, in MiB — the build-time RAM ceiling / throughput
  # knob. Higher = fewer, larger segments (faster bulk ingest, more RAM). Omit
  # for the 50 MiB default; values below Tantivy's ~15 MiB minimum are clamped
  # up (so 0 is *not* unlimited here).
  writer_heap_mb: 50
```

These apply on `index` and `reindex`; use `indice stats` to see their effect on the footprint. After **upgrading** to a version that changes the index schema or these defaults, run `indice reindex` to rebuild — that's how existing homes pick up footprint improvements (a stale index built by an older version is detected, and indice tells you to reindex).
